The whole point of the repo is to have a reference how to make the Deendabot auto merge its pull-request.

The app's code is irrelevant - it's a CRA app just so that there could be more js modules that would from time to time updated - so easier to test the Dependabot.

The meat of the repo is in its GitHub Actions. 
Note!!! DEPENDABOT_AUTOMERGE_TOKEN is a custom created secret.
